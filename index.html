        <h1 class="impH1">What is <b>Mental Health?</b></h1>
        <p class="pp">
          Mental health is a multifaceted aspect of overall well-being,
          extending beyond the mere absence of mental disorders or disabilities,
          as underscored by the World Health Organization (WHO). It encapsulates
          the proactive cultivation of ongoing wellness and happiness, not only
          on an individual level but also within the fabric of our communities.
          Recognizing and prioritizing mental health is not just a personal
          endeavor but a collective responsibility that holds profound
          significance at both community and societal levels.
        </p>
        <p class="pp">
          In the United States, the prevalence of mental health issues is
          strikingly evident, with nearly one in five adults grappling with such
          challenges annually, according to statistics from the National
          Alliance on Mental Illness. Moreover, the impact of serious
          psychological conditions reverberates significantly, affecting an
          estimated 14.2 million adults in 2020 alone, as reported by the
          National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). These statistics
          underscore the urgent need for increased awareness, support, and
          action to address mental health concerns and promote holistic
          well-being across society.

        <h1>How do mental health professionals diagnose disorders?</h1>
        <p class="pp">
          Mental health professionals diagnose disorders through a meticulous
          process involving various assessments and discussions. Initially, they
          conduct a comprehensive review of the individual's medical history,
          considering any prior physical or mental health conditions within the
          individual or their family. Subsequently, a thorough physical
          examination may be conducted to identify or rule out any underlying
          physical conditions contributing to the individual's symptoms.
          Engaging in in-depth conversations with the individual further aids in
          understanding their current concerns, experiences, and symptoms,
          facilitating the formulation of an accurate diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p class="pp">
          By combining medical history reviews, physical examinations, and
          discussions with the individual, mental health professionals gain a
          holistic understanding of the individual's mental well-being. This
          approach ensures that all potential factors influencing the
          individual's mental health are considered, allowing for accurate
          diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. Ultimately, this
          collaborative diagnostic process empowers individuals to receive the
          support and interventions necessary to address their mental health
          challenges effectively.
